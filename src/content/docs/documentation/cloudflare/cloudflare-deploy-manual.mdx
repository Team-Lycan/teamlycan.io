# Deploying Astro with SSR on Cloudflare: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Astro is a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) enhances its performance by pre-rendering pages on the server. Deploying Astro with SSR on Cloudflare leverages Cloudflare's edge network for even faster delivery. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Create a New Astro Project
Astro supports SSR out of the box. Ensure your `astro.config.mjs` is set up for SSR:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  output: 'server',
  // ...
};
```

## Step 3: Build Your Astro Project

Build your project to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a `dist` directory with your server-side rendered site.





## Step 4: Set Up Cloudflare Workers

1. **Sign Up/Login to Cloudflare:** Go to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and sign up or log in.
2. **Create a Workers Project:** Navigate to the Workers section and create a new project.
3. **Install Wrangler CLI:** Cloudflareâ€™s command-line tool for managing Workers projects.

   ```bash
   pnpm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
   ```

4. **Authenticate Wrangler:** 

   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

## Step 5: Configure Your Worker

1. **Generate a New Worker:**

   ```bash
   wrangler generate my-astro-project
   ```

2. **Configure `wrangler.toml`:** Replace the contents of `wrangler.toml` in your new Worker directory with:

   ```toml
   name = "my-astro-project"
   account_id = "yourCloudflareAccountId"
   workers_dev = true
   route = ""
   zone_id = ""

   [site]
   bucket = "./dist"
   entry-point = "workers-site"
   ```

   Replace `yourCloudflareAccountId` with your actual Cloudflare account ID.

3. **Copy Built Files:** Copy the `dist` folder from your Astro project into the Worker directory.

## Step 6: Deploy to Cloudflare

1. **Publish Your Worker:**

   ```bash
   wrangler publish
   ```

2. **Visit Your Deployed Site:** After the deployment, Wrangler will provide a URL to view your deployed site.

## Step 7: Verify and Monitor

- **Verify Deployment:** Visit the provided URL to ensure your Astro site is live.
- **Monitor Performance:** Utilize Cloudflare's analytics to monitor your site's performance.

## Conclusion

Deploying Astro with SSR on Cloudflare is a straightforward process that brings the speed and reliability of Cloudflare's edge network to your Astro projects.
